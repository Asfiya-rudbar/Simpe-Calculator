# Simpe-Calculator

ðŸŒŸ Thrilled to share my latest project: a **Simple Calculator** created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸ§®âœ¨

This calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, providing users with a straightforward way to crunch numbers. It was a great exercise in handling user input and implementing basic arithmetic functions.

Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback! ðŸ’»
